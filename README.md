Time Series Data Analysis Project
This repository documents my ongoing project based on a Time Series Data course from Data Camp, adapted through my current university studies. Here, I use Pandas to index, resample, and analyze time series data, focusing on techniques like rolling and cumulative calculations, and building a value-weighted stock index from actual data.

As my understanding deepens through my academic journey, I plan to expand this repository with additional insights and advanced methodologies related to time series analysis. Feel free to explore the code and utilize it in your own projects.
